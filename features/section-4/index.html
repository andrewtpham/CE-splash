<p>The TolaData team is available for remote support or in-person trainings to help teams define their specific use cases and requirements for data collection, discovery and analysis. We believe in helping our clients customize TolaData’s open tools to allow each program’s unique goals and circumstances to be met. During this process we retain open source and open data core strategies allowing for easier collaboration and aggregation to provide the greatest benefit for beneficiaries, teams, and donors.</p>

<p>The combination of these tools and team support provide not just a verifiable set of data but a transferable learning experience that helps individual programs and countries adapt and grow while sharing information with stakeholders across the globe.</p>
