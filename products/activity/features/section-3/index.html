<p>The Indicator Tracking tool is used to create a set of activity, output, outcome and goal indicators for each program, helping donors and staff track the performance of a program or project. The indicators are defined and agreed upon by the donor(s) before a program is created in the system, then imported via a data service or manually entered.</p>

<p>Progress against each indicator is documented via data entry forms directly through the system, or imported through a digital data collection tool or consolidator like TolaTables. These indicators are then linked back to projects tracked through Project Workflow to outline targets vs. actuals.</p>
