<p>Through the course of engagement with country teams, the TolaData team has noticed some common challenges around effective collection and usage of data.  Legacy tools and processes, coupled with resource limitations, frequently lead to incomplete, poor-quality data, obscuring key takeaways from program managers and country leadership.  Additionally - lacking relevant, targeted support - teams struggle to articulate a cohesive data workflow capable of bridging the gap between data collection and evidence-based, adaptive program management and the incorporation of key lessons learned into future programming.  In response to these needs, the team created the TolaScience unit, which builds off of the wider TolaData platform to deliver data-driven insight to teams operating worldwide.</p>
